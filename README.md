# About
Having toyed around with computer vision in the past and being frustrated with the price and writing experience of existing "smart paper" ecosystems, I decided to develop my own. Currently under the working title of Papier Libéré ("paper, freed" in French), it's still very much still in a prototype state due to lack of time, both in terms of features and code quality, but the image importing process is very much functional!

# Features
- Completely open source!
- All image processing happens locally (cloud currently used for authentication and eventually for configuration and (optionally) scan storage).
- New document formats can be easily added by anyone.
- Adaptive white balance adjusts for partial shading of the scan.
- Formats can include markable icons (eventually to be used for categorization).
